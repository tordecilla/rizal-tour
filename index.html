    <p>Have you ever stopped to think that there might be a bit of José Rizal in each of us? Or perhaps, more curiously, that we might find a part of ourselves in him? It may sound like a cliché—but walk with us through Madrid, and you'll start to see how that idea makes perfect sense. 

When Rizal arrived in this city in the early 1880s, he wasn’t just a student from a distant colony. He was a young man with dreams, doubts, and a deep love for his homeland. Like many Filipinos who first arrive in Spain today, he sought comfort in familiar faces, looked for a relative to take him in, and quietly compared this grand European capital to the warm memories of his Kalamba and the serene waters of Laguna de Bye. He missed home. He got lonely. 

And yes—he also experienced moments of lightness amid the solitude. While we don’t have records of Rizal visiting places like the Rastro, the zoo, or the Plaza de Toros, it’s not hard to imagine that a curious and observant young man like him might have been drawn to those popular spots, if only to understand the rhythms of Madrileño life. 

After all, he was trying to make sense of the Spain that ruled his homeland: Why do people eat dinner at ten? Why do conversations stretch late into the night over tiny cups of coffee? How do people live, celebrate, struggle, and dream in this imperial capital? 

But of course, Rizal was also someone apart. He wasn’t just any migrant—he was a thinker, a writer, and a revolutionary in the making. While others may have passed the time in bars or gossiped over merienda, Rizal was in the library, pouring over books, refining his ideas. He walked these same streets we’ll walk today, but with a deeper mission. He wasn't only trying to find himself—he was trying to find a way to free his country. 

So as we explore “Rizal’s Madrid,” we’re not just visiting old buildings and cobblestone corners. We’re stepping into the places where he learned, struggled, wrote, and imagined a better future. This isn’t just a sightseeing tour—it’s a journey into the heart of a man who believed, as Ninoy Aquino would say many years later, that the land of our birth is truly “worth dying for.”</p>

    <div class="section-nav"><a href="#stop-0">« Previous: Introduction</a> | <a href="#stop-2">Next: Calle Amor de Dios 13‑15 »</a></div>
    <p>We begin our journey at the Facultad de Medicina of the Universidad Central de Madrid, located along Calle Atocha, where José Rizal formally enrolled in medical school on October 2, 1882. Today, a marker in the corridor of the old Colegio de Medicina—part of the Hospital de San Carlos—commemorates this significant chapter in his life.

Rizal completed his degree in June 1884, just two years later, a testament to his discipline and sharp intellect. Among his professors was the well-known Marqués de Busto, as well as Drs. Mariani, Polo, and Stocker, whom he would later mention in letters home.

He likely completed part of his practical training at the Hospital de la Princesa, where he once told his family he had performed two operations on detached ligatures.

Yet even as he progressed in his medical studies, it became clear that medicine was not his ultimate calling. His motivation stemmed less from professional ambition and more from personal devotion—he hoped to treat his mother, Teodora Alonso, who was slowly going blind. Her condition had worsened to the point where she could only write to him with the help of one of her daughters. Rizal’s concern for her eyesight would eventually lead him to Paris, where he pursued further specialization in ophthalmology.

This stop reminds us that even Rizal’s academic achievements were rooted in deeply human and emotional reasons.

From here, we make our way to Calle Amor de Dios 13–15, the first place Rizal called home in Madrid.</p>

    <p>Our next stop brings us to Calle Amor de Dios 13–15, where José Rizal lived from September 12, 1882, to May 1883—his first residence in Madrid.

Just 21 years old and newly arrived from the Philippines, Rizal was prepared to live modestly. He had a limited monthly allowance of 50 pesos, which was later reduced to 35 due to a poor harvest on their family farm in Calamba and increasing rent demands from the Dominican landlords.

Here in this house, Rizal shared the space with Vicente González, a friend from his Ateneo de Manila days, whom he affectionately nicknamed the Marqués de Pagong—the “Marquis of Turtle”—perhaps for his laid-back ways.

The choice of this house may have been practical: it was close to the Universidad Central and also near an art studio where Rizal’s interest in drawing and sculpture took on new life. Every saved cent counted, and living nearby meant fewer expenses for transport.

The house reportedly had a piano and four large mirrors—details that left a strong impression on Rizal and perhaps symbolized a more cultured environment than he might have expected to find.

From here, we walk toward Calle Atocha 43, where the spirit of Rizal’s pen would find a larger voice—in La Solidaridad.</p>

    <div class="section-nav"><a href="#stop-2">« Previous: Calle Amor de Dios 13‑15</a> | <a href="#stop-4">Next: Calle Fernández y González 8, 3º‑4 »</a></div>
    <p>We now arrive at Calle Atocha 43, the former office of La Solidaridad—a cornerstone of the Filipino reform movement in Spain. Established in 1889, this newspaper became the collective voice of Filipino expatriates fighting not for independence yet, but for reform, equality, and autonomy under Spanish rule.

While Rizal was not part of the editorial staff and had already left Madrid by the time La Solidaridad was founded, it’s likely that he visited this address during later trips, especially to monitor the publication of his essays. Among the most impactful was La Indolencia de los Filipinos (The Indolence of the Filipinos), where Rizal responded to the widespread Spanish belief that Filipinos were lazy and therefore unfit for progress.

With sharp logic and historical insight, Rizal argued that the so-called indolence was the result of environmental, social, and colonial factors—not an inherent trait. He pointed to the Philippines' hot, humid climate as a natural deterrent to hard labor and reminded readers that even Spaniards were often considered lazy by northern Europeans.

But Rizal didn’t stop at critique; he laid out constructive proposals for Philippine development, drawing on ideas from fellow reformist Gregorio Sanciangco y Goson—like building railroads, modernizing agriculture, and addressing unjust land ownership.

This stop isn’t just about a newspaper—it’s about how ideas take root, circulate, and begin to move people.

From here, we continue to Calle Fernández y González, where Rizal and his fellow ilustrados gathered to shape these very ideas into action.</p>

    <p>Just across from our next stop is Calle Fernández y González 8, 3º‑4, where José Rizal lived briefly from May to June 17, 1883, before heading off to Paris for a vacation. This apartment, tucked behind the Teatro Español and close to the lively Plaza Santa Ana, placed Rizal in the heart of old Madrid.

But not everything about this location was to his liking. In his writings, he remarked critically on the tendency of some fellow residents—likely students or compatriots—to spend their days in endless, often superficial conversation.

Rizal, ever the disciplined scholar, preferred more productive use of time. He shared this space with Eduardo de Lete and Ceferino de León, both active members of the Filipino community in Madrid.

Notably, the three made a conscious decision to keep their residence free of gambling—no juego de azar allowed—which hints at their shared values and perhaps their desire to focus on more serious matters.

Now, just a few steps down the same street, we arrive at a place where leisure did have its place in Rizal’s life—Viva Madrid, at number 7.</p>

    <p>Here we find Viva Madrid, a favorite hangout of José Rizal and other members of the Filipino community during their time in Madrid. Known for its elegant azulejos—glazed ceramic tile murals that still adorn its walls today—this classic taberna offered more than just meals.

Rizal would often stop in for a light bite and a glass of wine, enjoying a bit of leisure between his studies and writing.

He wasn’t alone—Graciano López Jaena, ever the social butterfly, was also a regular here, famously described as “a man of the world and of wine.”

A plaque inside proudly commemorates the establishment’s ties to the Filipino reformists of the 19th century.

This stop reminds us that Rizal’s life wasn’t all books and letters; there were also moments of pleasure, of laughter, of quiet observation. We can imagine him here with friends, seated near the window, sipping wine while watching the world go by—perhaps even exchanging glances with the señoritas passing through the plaza.

In one letter, Rizal even mentioned spending two pesetas and 90 céntimos for a bye-le at El Excelsior—likely a nearby dance hall open to the public, reflecting the social customs of the time.

From here, we continue just around the corner to another landmark of Rizal’s Madrid—the historic Hotel Inglés at Calle Echegaray 8.</p>

    <p>Just a few steps from our last stop stands Hotel Inglés, at number 8 Calle Echegaray—one of the most historically significant venues for the Filipino community in Madrid.

While places like Restaurante Madrid also served as gathering spots, it was here at Hotel Inglés that many of the most important celebrations took place. Most notably, in 1884, this hotel hosted the famous banquet in honor of Juan Luna and Félix Resurrección Hidalgo, whose victories at the Madrid Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes marked a turning point for Filipino pride on the world stage.

That night, Rizal gave a speech that electrified the audience—declaring that the artistic triumphs of Luna and Hidalgo were proof that Filipinos were just as capable as any European, given the same opportunities.

Today, the hotel still retains much of its 19th-century charm. In the lobby, you’ll find a commemorative plaque displaying the year it was built, the kinds of events it hosted—including zarzuelas, concerts, and plays—and even a replica of the type of menu served at such grand occasions. Paintings on the walls show what the hotel looked like in Rizal’s day.

Beyond the Luna-Hidalgo banquet, the Filipino community often gathered here for cenas—formal dinners—especially to celebrate New Year’s.

That tradition of cultural connection lives on: even in the modern era, Hotel Inglés has welcomed Filipino events, such as the 1998 centennial celebration of the Philippine Revolution and the First Republic, attended by President Fidel Ramos.

From this storied venue, we continue just down the street to Los Gabrielles at Calle Echegaray 17, once a vibrant symbol of Madrid’s nightlife.</p>

    <p>At number 17 Calle Echegaray stands Los Gabrieles, once a favorite meeting place for the Filipino propagandists during their years in Madrid. More than just a bar, it served as an informal salon—where ideas were debated, camaraderie was built, and the seeds of reform took deeper root. 

In a letter to his sisters, Rizal described two ceramic tile murals that caught his attention here. One was a whimsical image of skeletons forming a musical band—humorously labeled the “Balandristas”—playing guitars and other instruments in skeletal celebration. Facing it was a softer scene: young women on a picnic in the countryside, evoking the pastoral elegance of Goya’s Spain. These contrasting images perhaps reflected the mood of the gatherings—equal parts laughter, culture, and serious discussion.

It was in venues like this that Rizal and his fellow students sharpened their positions on key issues affecting the Philippines.

Today, Los Gabrieles continues to celebrate Spanish artistic tradition, now as a venue for flamenco performances and live music, while proudly maintaining its 19th-century charm. It still serves a rich selection of Spanish wines, and like in Rizal’s day, the spirit of conversation and culture fills the room—from dusk until well past midnight.

From here, we move on to Calle Ventura De Vega, where lively debates and quiet heartbreak would both leave their mark on Rizal.

    <p>Here at Calle Ventura de la Vega, stood the residence of Don Pablo Ortiga y Rey, vice president of the Consejo de Filipinas and a key figure in colonial administration.

This address was more than a private home—it also served as the headquarters of the Círculo Hispano-Filipino, a society that aimed to foster mutual understanding between Spaniards and Filipinos.

In a letter to his family dated October 10, 1882, Rizal noted that he would later board here, beginning in the autumn of 1883 until around August 1884.

It appears this arrangement was somewhat temporary, as records and correspondence suggest Rizal moved between several residences during his time in Madrid. Nonetheless, this stop reflects the importance of strategic social connections in Rizal’s life. Don Pablo’s daughter, Consuelo Ortiga y Rey, would later appear in Rizal’s diary—proof that even in places of diplomacy and debate, personal stories unfolded.

From here, we continue our journey to the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando on Calle Alcalá 13, where Rizal explored another dimension of his talent: the visual arts.</p>

    <p>Just down this quiet stretch of Calle del Prado stands the Ateneo de Madrid, one of the city’s oldest cultural institutions and a place that helped shape Rizal in ways beyond the classroom. Though it wasn’t a university, it was an exclusive club for scholars, writers, and scientists—a space where ideas were exchanged and culture was celebrated. Rizal came here often. He attended poetry readings, musical recitals, theatrical performances, and book launches. 

In 1884, he was in the audience when the celebrated poet Ramón de Campoamor delivered what many considered his finest work. Rizal also took English lessons here with a teacher named Sr. Schüts, always eager to sharpen his command of languages. On one occasion, he was even introduced to the Prince of Bavaria, who happened to be presiding over the event that day.

Even now, stepping into the Ateneo feels like entering another time. The rooms are quiet, the ceilings high, the galleries lined with portraits of Spain’s great thinkers—including, at one point, José Rizal himself, whose image once hung at the end of the hallway. The theatre, still intact, has the look of a classical stage—like something out of a Greek play.

From here, we make our way just across Plaza de las Cortes to the next stop: the Congreso de los Diputados, where Filipinos once pushed to have their voices heard in the heart of the Spanish empire.</p>

    <p>Just across Plaza de las Cortes stands the Congreso de los Diputados, Spain’s parliament building and one of the most symbolically important sites for the Filipino reformists in Madrid. It was here that members of the Filipino community lobbied—directly and indirectly—for civil rights, autonomy, and equal treatment under Spanish law. While Rizal himself never spoke inside these chambers, his essays, speeches, and the reform movement he helped lead all fed into the pressure for recognition. This was the heart of Spanish political power, and for Filipino students and expatriates, standing outside these gates meant standing at the very center of empire, demanding to be seen.

Fittingly, just across from the building is a monument to Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote. Like Cervantes’ idealistic knight, Rizal believed in the power of ideas to challenge injustice—no matter how impossible the odds.

From here, we head west toward Calle Gran Vía, formerly Calle San Miguel, where Rizal lived in a small boarding house during the early part of his stay in Madrid.</p>

    <p>Here at Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Rizal briefly nurtured his artistic side. While pursuing his medical degree at the Universidad Central, Rizal also enrolled here for painting lessons under the Belgian-born Spanish landscape artist Carlos de Haes. For five hours a week, he explored form, color, and technique—revealing that his talents extended well beyond science and literature.

But Rizal’s academic interests were far from one-dimensional. He initially enrolled at the Facultad de Derecho (Faculty of Law) at the Universidad Central de Madrid, drawn by his growing political awareness and the desire to help shape legal reforms for the Philippines.

However, his older brother Paciano advised him to drop the course, likely out of concern for his focus and finances.

Eventually, Rizal gravitated toward what truly captured his heart: the humanities. He transferred to the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, where he completed his degree in June 1885.

At the time, this faculty was located on Calle Bernardo, in a building that now houses Spain’s Ministry of Justice.

From here, we trace Rizal’s footsteps once again—this time to Calle Barquillo 34, one of his later residences in Madrid.</p>

    <p>This address—now along Madrid’s bustling Calle Gran Vía, but formerly known as Calle San Miguel—was one of the early pensions where José Rizal stayed during his student years.

In a letter to his parents dated September 11, 1883, he mentioned that he began boarding here on September 6, paying four pesetas per day. That amount, he noted, didn’t even include kerosene, which he had to purchase separately just to study at night—a small but telling detail about the challenges of student life abroad.

Despite the location and his determination to continue his studies, it seems the setup may not have been ideal. Not long after, Rizal moved again, this time choosing to share accommodations with a fellow Filipino student, possibly in search of both companionship and a more manageable cost of living.

From here, we continue to Calle Barquillo 34, another residence that marked a later chapter in Rizal’s time in Madrid.</p>

    <p>We now arrive at Calle del Barquillo, where José Rizal moved after his brief stay on Calle San Miguel. In the same September 11, 1883 letter to his parents, he asked that all future correspondence be sent to this address—suggesting he saw this place as more stable.

Here, he shared quarters with Esteban Villanueva, a fellow Filipino who initially came to Madrid to study law but would later become known as a painter. The arts seemed to hold a special appeal for many Filipinos in Spain—Luna, Hidalgo, Melecio Figueroa, and Villanueva among them—and Rizal, too, found inspiration in their creative world.

Yet even as he thrived intellectually, Rizal was struggling financially. In his letters, he reported excellent grades in medicine, victories in Greek contests, and high marks in Historia Universal, but he also admitted to pawning a ring given by his sister Saturnina just to pay for his exams. At one point, he went an entire day without a single meal.

Despite this, he remained active in the Filipino community. Around this time, he was invited by the influential Paterno family to deliver a speech at the now-famous 1884 banquet honoring Juan Luna and Félix Resurrección Hidalgo for their award-winning works at the Exposición de Bellas Artes. Rizal described the event in his diary using coded script, which was later deciphered by Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno at the request of Wenceslao Retana.

From Barquillo, we continue to Calle Pizarro 15, 2º Derecha, another of Rizal’s Madrid residences during this formative and turbulent period of his life.</p>

    <p>At Calle Pizarro, José Rizal lived with his fellow Filipino students Ceferino de León and Julio Llorente, as he wrote in a letter to his family dated August 29, 1884.

This apartment was conveniently located near the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras on Calle Bernardo, where Rizal was completing his degree in humanities—an achievement he would accomplish the following year.

His letters from this address reflect a deepening awareness of global economics and their impact on the Philippines. In one, he explained why sugar prices had fallen: the U.S. had begun sourcing more of its imports from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and British colonies, pushing the Philippines aside as a major supplier.

But Pizarro 15 holds even greater significance—this is the place where, in quiet determination, Rizal began writing the early chapters of what would become his groundbreaking novel, Noli Me Tangere.

From here, we continue to Calle Cedaceros 11, piso principal, the last known residence of Rizal in Madrid.</p>

    <p>At Calle Cedaceros, we reach what was likely José Rizal’s final residence in Madrid, as he noted in an undated letter to his family. He stayed here briefly—from October 1 to 15, 1885—sharing the apartment with fellow Filipinos Ceferino de León and Eduardo de Lete.

By this time, Rizal had completed his formal studies in Madrid and was preparing for the next phase of his journey: advanced training in ophthalmology in Paris and Berlin, where he intended to study under the most renowned specialists in Europe.

His decision was deeply personal. His mother, Teodora Alonso, was rapidly losing her sight, and Rizal’s goal was to one day treat her himself. As he began to consider returning to the Philippines, his brother Paciano cautioned him against it. Rizal’s growing reputation as a bold critic of the colonial system—especially after his speech at the Hotel Inglés praising Luna and Hidalgo—had made him a marked man.

Paciano urged him to go to Hong Kong instead, where he could be closer to home but out of immediate danger.

Spanish authorities and friars, offended by Rizal’s assertion that Filipinos were capable of greatness if given the chance, had begun to see him as a threat.

From this quiet residence, Rizal would step out into the larger world—with a mission, and with mounting risk.

Our next stop takes us to Parque del Buen Retiro, a place of leisure that offered Rizal occasional escape from the pressures of his life in Madrid.</p>

    <p>Parque del Buen Retiro

We now find ourselves in Parque del Buen Retiro, Rizal’s favorite escape in Madrid. This peaceful stretch of gardens, fountains, and tree-lined paths offered him a break from lectures, letters, and late-night study sessions. He loved it so much, in fact, that years later, when he was exiled in Dapitan, he named his coastal home “Mi Retiro”—My Retreat—after this very place.

But the park wasn’t just a personal refuge. In 1887, it also became the site of the Exposición de Filipinas, a grand colonial exhibition meant to showcase the Spanish Empire’s overseas territories. Inside the Palacio de Cristal, Spain displayed Philippine art, artifacts, and botanical specimens.

But there was also something much darker: the exhibit included live displays of indigenous Filipinos—Igorots, Manobos, Negritos—presented as exotic “samples” of the colony’s population. To Rizal, it was a dehumanizing spectacle. He condemned the exhibition for its cruelty and racism, calling out “civilized” Spain for violating the basic dignity of his fellow Filipinos.

The pain cut even deeper when one of the Igorot women died during the harsh Madrid winter, and others fell ill from pneumonia—left unprotected in the cold, for the amusement of the public.

From this park—so full of beauty and contradiction—we now make our way to our final stop: the Rizal Monument, a tribute to the man whose time in Madrid helped shape the future of a nation.</p>

    <p>We end our journey at the junction of Avenida de las Islas Filipinas and Calle Santander, where the Rizal Monument quietly stands—a familiar sight to any Filipino, yet deeply meaningful here in Madrid. Inaugurated in 1996, this monument is a replica of the one in Luneta, Manila, designed by Swiss sculptor Richard Kissling, who won a design competition during the American era in the Philippines. It’s a fitting place to conclude—not just because it honors Rizal, but because it reflects how far history, and memory, have come.

Back in 1961, during the centennial of Rizal’s birth, several countries paid tribute to him. Germany honored him in Heidelberg, the city he immortalized in To the Flowers of Heidelberg. Mexico City built a replica of the Luneta monument on its grand Paseo de la Reforma. But Spain did not. At the time, Rizal was still seen by many here as a traitor—someone who turned his back on the mother country.

But times have changed. In a new era of friendship between Spain and the Philippines, and with a deeper understanding of why Rizal called for change, his legacy has been re-evaluated. He is now remembered not as a rebel, but as a visionary—someone who sought justice through reason and reform. He is not only a Filipino patriot; he is an exemplar of the best in the human race. And Spain itself is honored by Rizal’s presence here, for it is in this country that he developed his sensitivities and his scientific, artistic, and literary skills—in Madrid, the heartland of the Empire.

And so we end our walk where Rizal’s story in Madrid comes full circle—his footsteps still echoing through these streets, his ideas still alive in the hearts of those who follow them.</p>
